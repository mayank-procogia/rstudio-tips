## Introduction

::: incremental
-   R is primarily a statistical language developed in 1993-1995 by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.
-   Over the years, R has matured to be one of the preferred languages in the coding arsenal of Statisticians, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Data Miners.
-   Application Domains: **Healthcare**, Academics, Consulting, Finance, Insurance, Media, and many more.
-   Most famous applicability trend: Machine Learning, Data/Business Analytics, Data Visualization, Dashboard Development, and Analytics Application Development.
-   R is available across platforms - Windows, Linux, MacOS.

## Interesting Facts about R

::: incremental
-   R is open-source programming language with its roots from `S` programming language.
-   R was conceived in 1993, initial version was released in 1995 and a stable R version was released in 2000.
-   It was named after the first names of its first two authors.
-   A hidden gem, R supports both procedural programming and object-oriented programming.
-   The number of R packages available either through CRAN or GitHub is 1, 00, 000 and they do epic stuff with just one line of code. It could range from Regression to Bayesian analysis.
-   Started gaining popularity for its support for reproducible workflow from researchers at academia.

## Why use R?

::: incremental
-   **878 R User groups, 90 countries, 414 cities, 775,379 members.**
-   Open-Source programming language.
-   Rich eco-system to help end-to-end analytics flow from data sourcing, data loading, data manipulation, data engineering, analytics, dashboard development, report renders, automated emails to schedulers.
-   Ability to integrate with other programming languages - Python, Java, .Net, C, C++ and much more.
-   Has one of the strongest vast active community of R users, growing day-by-day.
-   Multiple micro communities to share learnings - R Ladies, R Consortium, R Stats, R Weekly, R Users, Data Science Hangout,
-   Backed by POSIT ongoing innovation and focus on ease of use and expanding capabilities.

## RStudio IDE 

![](data/img_rstudio_ide.png){style="width:50%;"}

## RStudio IDE Continued

-   RStudio is the preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R programming.
-   RStudio is free and open source.
-   USP: version control and project management.
-   RStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen:
    -   Source Editor
    -   Console
    -   Work space Browser (and History), and
    -   Plots (and Files, Packages, Help).
